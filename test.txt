Hello, I'm David and I'm a programmer.
\n
And I've been now engaging in this dark art for 3 years now.
My family has tried to intervene... to no avail.
Sometimes I feel doomed. But I keep coming back to the feeling of getting a for loop to work for the first time. Those were the days.
I'm not sure if I really need help or not. But sometimes I look myself in the mirror if it's still the same person there.
If it's the same river like the bhuddists say.
Right?
